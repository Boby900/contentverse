**TODOs**

1. use npm for the whole project, don't use bun or pnpm.
2. take inspiration from some cms, could be tinybase or pocketbase.
3. use Tanstack start for the frontend framework.
4. add email services to greet the users, could be like welcome to contentverse when they sign up.
6. add the GitHub's auth. [link](https://lucia-auth.com/tutorials/github-oauth/)
7. add some mocktests using the vitest for checking the endpoints.
8. add the content type in the returning responses and wrap every requests in the try-catch block, mostly content routes and do some refining.
